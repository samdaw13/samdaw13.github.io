            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>I spent 24 hours using my phone to browse the web, and keep track of the websites I visited and record my thoughts on what I thought and felt about them. I feel that I followed the instructions exactally, even though I didn't reall do a lot of browing, mostly because I don't do a lot of browsing.</p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>I was able to see  fine most things that I was looking for, even though it felt slower than usual. For example in Facebook I was able to scroll through my news feed quite easily and see what was going on.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>I was able to find most of the things I was looking for, but sometimes it was a bit of a fight. Like on the genius website it was kinda hard to find the information that I was looking for.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>Yes, basically I was able to accomplish everything I wanted to. For example, in lds.org I was able to find the conference talks quite easily and listen to the talk I wanted to with ease. </p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Mostly sometimes it was really quite slow on the mobile device, things were just more difficult in general because of the tiny screen and everything having to be reorganized. Mostly with the genius websited, that was a little difficult to navigate, and it was slow, and had a lot of ads that made things worse.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>The only site that I felt was better was Facebook, but that is mostly because I use it baslicaly always on my phone.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Well, I've browsed quite often on my phone in the past, so nothing to suprising, but it was interesting to see how some sites preformed on my phone.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng" target="_blank">LDS</a></li>
