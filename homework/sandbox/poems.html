        <h2>I</h2>
        <p>Half a league, half a league,<br> Half a league onward,<br> All in the valley of Death <br> Rode the six hundred.<br> <q>Forward, the Light Brigade!<br> Charge for the guns!</q> he said.<br> Into the valley of Death <br> Rode the six hundred.</p>
        <h2>II</h2>
        <p><q>Forward, the Light Brigade!</q><br> Was there a man dismayed?<br> Not though the soldier knew<br> Someone had blundered.<br> Theirs not to make reply,<br> Theirs not to reason why,<br> Theirs but to do and die.<br> Into the valley of Death<br> Rode the six hundred. </p>
        <h2>III</h2>
        <p>Cannon to right of them,<br> Cannon to left of them,<br> Cannon in front of them<br> Volleyed and thundered;<br> Stormed at with shot and shell,<br> Boldly they rode and well,<br> Into the jaws of Death,<br> Into the mouth of hell<br> Rode the six hundred.</p>
        <h2>IV</h2>
        <p>Flashed all their sabres bare,<br> Flashed as they turned in air<br> Sabring the gunners there,<br> Charging an army, while<br> All the world wondered.<br> Plunged in the battery-smoke<br> Right through the line they broke;<br> Cossack and Russian<br> Reeled from the sabre stroke<br> Shattered and sundered.<br> Then they rode back, but not<br> Not the six hundred. </p>
        <h2>V</h2>
        <p>Cannon to right of them,<br> Cannon to left of them,<br> Cannon behind them<br> Volleyed and thundered;<br> Stormed at with shot and shell,<br> While horse and hero fell.<br> They that had fought so well<br> Came through the jaws of Death,<br> Back from the mouth of hell,<br> All that was left of them,<br> Left of six hundred. </p>
        <h2>VI</h2>
        <p>When can their glory fade?<br> O the wild charge they made!<br> All the world wondered.<br> Honour the charge they made!<br> Honour the Light Brigade,<br> Noble six hundred!</p>
