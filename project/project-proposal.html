                <h1>Purpose</h1>
                <p>I have always enjoyed studying the second world war, and I would like to make a site that provides some basic information about the war. Each page will describe various points of the war, and the people involved. There will be information pulled from a JSON file dealing statistics of various battles, such as when they happened, who won, and casualties dealt to both sides of the fight. The target audience would be high school students, and college students. The sites purpose will be to provide the information is a simple, and easy way to read and try to build interest on the subject.</p>
