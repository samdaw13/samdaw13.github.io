He was assigned to spy on one of the political parties, the German Workers Party. He quickly realized that he could add to this little party, he joined the party, and forced them to make him the Dictator for Life of the party. He changed the name to the Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party, or the Nazi Party.</p><br><p>&nbsp;After a failed attempt to illegally seize power, Hitler realized he would have to use the new Weimar Constitution to rise to power. He quickly began to gain support by feeding on the misery of the people during the Great Depression. Eventually he was elected Chancellor of Germany, and the President died, leaving a provision in his will to support Hitler, Hitler took this to mean that he should also be the President. Shortly afterwards, he gave himself dictatorial powers over Germany, and began to prepare for war.</p><br>"

Furthermore, the Soviet Union was spreading it's communist doctrine to the world, and many Italians feared Italy would too, become a communist nation.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Mussolini's party fed off of these fears, and promised to fix the economic crisis, stop the communists, and restore Italy to the glory of the Roman Empire.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Mussolini and his Black Shirt militia began their March on Rome, and when the police refused to stop them, the King of Italy gave control of the government to Mussolini, by granting him emergency powers for one year. However, Mussolini never let go of his power, and thus unwittingly, the King of Italy plunged Italy into a dictatorship that would last for twenty years.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Quickly Mussolini eliminated all opposition to his political party, and began to attempt to fix the economy. He also chose to conquer the Kingdom of Ethiopia, one of the last independent nations in Africa. The king of Ethiopia pleaded with the League of Nations for support, but other than sanctions against Italy, no support was provided.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Although initially Italy was not friendly with Nazi Germany, eventually Italy became Germany's closest ally when the war began.</p><br>"

        "risetopower": "<p>&nbsp;Hirohito himself didn't really rise to power as did the other dictators. Rather, during the 19th century, the United States introduced the power of the West to the Empire of Japan. Shortly after the Emperor overthrew the Shogun, known as the Meiji Restoration, and shortly after began to quickly westernize the Empire of Japan.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Part of Westernizing was that Japan needed to expand its borders well beyond what they currently were. Quickly Japan overran Korea at the close of the 19th century, and began a series of wars with Imperial Russia, in which Japan emerged victorious. Shortly after that Hirohito ascended the throne.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Despite these conquests, Japan was not immune to the Great Depression, forcing Japan to keep expanding her territory at the expense mostly of China. However, there was a lot of confusion because Hirohito rarely gave direct commands, rather he tried to help set up for these events to take place by firing generals and ministers. Eventually Japan controlled large portions of the Chinese coast, and in response America posed sanctions, thus forcing Japan to expand even further, leading to their part in the World War II."

As the Secretary General, he had the power to appoint people loyal to him to various positions in the government, in addition to this he also could read all the files of the party, and would spend hours finding who was loyal to who and who was important. Eventually Lenin did die, and a five-year power struggle began between Stalin and Trotsky. However, Trotsky did not have the power base Stalin had, and furthermore was not nearly as popular as Stalin was. Eventually due to these handicaps Stalin won the power struggle.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Stalin quickly seized ownership of the few industrial centers not already controlled by the government, primarily the farms in the Soviet Union, and killed several who resisted. This was to counter-act the Great Depression, which was crippling the world at the time. Shortly after, he purged the military of any not loyal to him, thus creating a timid and indecisive army. He used this army to attack Finland, which turned out to be a colossal military disaster for the Soviet Union. Shortly after that, World War II began.</p><br>"

In fact, he went so far as to split Poland with the Soviets. However, a new Prime minister had been elected to Great Britainâ€™s Parliament, and Winston Churchill would no longer appease Hitler, so Great Britain and France declared war on Germany.</p><br><p>&nbsp;The invasion of Poland itself was very quick, lasting just over one month, because the Germans implemented a new tactic called 'Blitzkrieg' or Lightning War. This tactic was extremely effective against the Polish army. Most of the Polish army surrendered to the Germans, hence the very high casualties.</p>"

Hitler countered by invading Denmark and Norway.</p><br><p>&nbsp;The invasion of Denmark was brief to say the least. The Danes saw what happened in Poland, and with most of their country adjacent to Germany, knew that their tiny army had no chance, so they surrendered almost without a fight.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Norway was trickier, Allied troops from Great Britain primarily had landed and were ready to support Norway. The Germans knew that if Norway had time to prepare, they could mine the fjords leading to their primary cities, making it very difficult to invade the country. So the Germans acted quickly, they sent their ships flying the Union Jack, pretending to be British Ships, thus tricking the Norwegians into letting them into their capital city of Oslo, and taking it with little resistance.</p><br><p>&nbsp;However, the King of Norway managed to escape, and began to conduct a guerilla warfare with what was left if his army, and the British soldiers in Norther Norway.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Ironically, it was in northern Norway where the British and German soldiers first fought each other. Although their defense was admirable, eventually trouble on the western front forced the British troops to leave, leaving the rest of Norway to the Germans to overrun.</p>"
