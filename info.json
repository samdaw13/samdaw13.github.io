He quickly began to gain support by feeding on the misery of the people during the Great Depression. Eventually he was elected Chancellor of Germany, and the President died, leaving a provision in his will to support Hitler, Hitler took this to mean that he should also be the President. Shortly afterwards, he gave himself dictatorial powers over Germany, and began to prepare for war.</p><br>"

Quickly Japan overran Korea at the close of the 19th century, and began a series of wars with Imperial Russia, in which Japan emerged victorious. Shortly after that Hirohito ascended the throne.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Despite these conquests, Japan was not immune to the Great Depression, forcing Japan to keep expanding her territory at the expense mostly of China. However, there was a lot of confusion because Hirohito rarely gave direct commands, rather he tried to help set up for these events to take place by firing generals and ministers. Eventually Japan controlled large portions of the Chinese coast, and in response America posed sanctions, thus forcing Japan to expand even further, leading to their part in the World War II."

            "description": "<p>&nbsp;Considered by many historians to be the bloodiest battle in history, Stalingrad is what broke the German offensive in the Soviet Union. Stalingrad was located in a place that it would be easy to cut off access to the oil fields south of the city in the Caucasus mountains. Furthermore the propaganda value of winning the battle named after the dictator of the Soviet Union could not be understated in the minds of Hitler and Stalin.</p><br><p>&nbsp; The city was almost totally overrun in the first months of fighting, but a few small pockets of Soviet resistance held out long enough for reinforcements to arrive over the river east of the city, prolonging the attack just long enough that winter began to set in. </p><br><p>&nbsp;At this point, the German generals knew that the position the German army in Stalingrad was in grave danger of being cut off, and the generals began to plead with Hitler to allow the men to retreat, in order to save their lives. But Hitler wouldn't have it. He felt that if they started to retreat now, it would devolve into an all-out rout, and the war would be lost. He felt that if the men just pushed a little harder, fought a little longer, then they would be triumphant.</p><br><p>&nbsp;However, ultimately, Hitler was wrong. The army in Stalingrad was cut off, a rescue was attempted by another German army, but the Soviet resistance was so intense they could not reach the city, and radioed the general in Stalingrad to meet them out of the city. However, out of loyalty to Hitler, the general refused.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Hitler ordered the men in Stalingrad to fight to the last man, to the last bullet, and to never give up. To say the least, once the army was cut off, the fighting didn't last much longer. The German soldiers were freezing, starving, and in desperate need of medical supplies, while on the other hand the Soviets kept getting fresh troops almost daily. The general in charge of the attack fought to the last, and surrendered.</p>"

However, Hitler did not see any value in this at all, and refused to offer much aid to the Italian army in north Africa.</p><br><p>&nbsp;The Italian army commenced an invasion of British held Egypt, and like Greece, it was a horrific disaster. Grudgingly, Hitler sent a very small force to help, under the command of Erwin Rommel. Rommel turned out to be such a brilliant tactician, that he easily pushed the British out of Libya, and into Egypt.</p><br><p>&nbsp;Rommel's greatest enemy was, not Montgomery, the British general, but rather a crippling lack of supplies. The British had destroyed almost every Axis ship that crossed into north Africa. When the critical battle of El Alamein began, the Germans lost simply because they ran out of gas.</p><br><p>&nbsp;This defeat rendered any attempt to take control of north Africa obsolete, and the Axis powers were forced to give up the area to the Allies.</p>"
